UofU Week 15 Assignment

This Assignment is broken down into three parts.

The first was gathering the data and for this assignment we go to [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and picked 2.5 quakes and greater in the past 30 days.

The second part is a HTML boilerplate provide accompanied with a ccs (also porvided) to us for this assignment. They create the enviroment and help with the sizing of the map.

The third part is the Java Script with focuse on Leaflet and d3 javascript libraries.  As with assignment 14 the creation of my code came with great help from two popular internet AIs  ChatGPT and BingAI.  I would not have been able to code this JS without their assistance.  By asking qeustions they help me with starter code that I then personalized and modified for my purposes.  

The required files to get this assignemt to work are all in the main branch of the responstory under the static folder and below is a quick reference list.

__index.html__</br>
