UofU Week 15 Assignment

This Assignment is broken down into three parts.

The first was gathering the data, and for this Assignment, we went to [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and picked 2.5 quakes and greater in the past 30 days.

The second part is an HTML boilerplate accompanied by a ccs (also provided) for this Assignment.  They create the environment and help with the sizing of the map.

The third part is JavaScript focusing on Leaflet and d3 javascript libraries.  As with assignment 14, creating my code came with great help from two popular internet AIs, ChatGPT and BingAI.  I would not have been able to code this JS without their assistance.  By asking questions, they helped me with a starter code that I then personalized and modified for my purposes.  

The required files to get this Assignment to work are all in the repository's main branch under the folders described below.

__index.html in the base folder__</br>
__logic.js in the static/js folder__

This Assignment is posted to GitHub Pages for access.
